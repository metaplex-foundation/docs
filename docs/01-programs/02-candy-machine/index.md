# Candy Machine

The Metaplex Protocol's Candy Machine is the leading minting and distribution program for fair NFT collection launches on Solana. It allows creators to bring their asset metadata on-chain, configure mints with anti-botting protection, and exchange SOL for randomized NFTs like a traditional candy machine.
