# Bot Tax

The **Bot Tax** guard charges a penalty for invalid transactions in order to discourage bots from attempting to mint NFTs.

This bot tax works in combinaison with other guards and will trigger whenever a minting wallet attempts to mint an NFT such that other guards would have rejected the mint.
