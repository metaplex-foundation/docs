# NFT Payment

## Overview

The **NFT Payment** guard allows minting by charging the payer an NFT from a specified NFT collection. The NFT will be transferred to a predefined destination.

If the payer does not own an NFT from the required collection, minting will fail.

## Guard Settings

The NFT Payment guard contains the following settings:

- **Required Collection**: The mint address of the required NFT Collection. The NFT we use to pay with must be part of this collection.
- **Destination**: The address of the wallet that will receive all NFTs.

Here’s an example of how to set up a Candy Machine using the NFT Payment guard. You may use any wallet as a destination but, in this example, we’ll use the address of the current identity.

```tsx
const { candyMachine } = await metaplex.candyMachines().create({
  // ...
  guards: {
    nftPayment: {
      requiredCollection: requiredCollectionNft.address,
      destination: metaplex.identity().publicKey,
    },
  },
});
```

## Mint Settings

The NFT Payment guard contains the following Mint Settings:

- **Mint**: The mint address of the NFT to pay with. This must be part of the required collection and must belong to the payer.
- **Token Account** (optional): You may optionally provide the token account linking the NFT with its owner explicitly. By default, the associated token account of the payer will be used.

Note that, if you’re planning on constructing instructions without the help of our SDKs, you will need to provide these Mint Settings and more as a combination of instruction arguments and remaining accounts. See the [Candy Guard’s program documentation](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/mpl-candy-guard#nftpayment) for more details.

<AccordionItem title="JS SDK" open={true}>
<div className="accordion-item-padding">

When minting via the JS SDK, simply provide the mint address of the NFT to pay with via the `mint` attribute like so.

```tsx
const { nft } = await metaplex.candyMachines().mint({
  // ...
  settings: {
    nftPayment: {
      mint: nftToPayWith.address,
    },
  }
});
```

You may also provide the `tokenAccount` attribute explicitly should the NFT not use an associated token account.
