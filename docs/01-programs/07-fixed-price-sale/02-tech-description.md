# Tech description

## Creators to sell something have to do next:

1. Create store

    - It's necessary because we have to filter Markets somehow

    - It will contain name, admin key, description

2. Initialise Selling resource. It can be either created one or our platform will create it.

    - Once user initialise selling resource we have an object with resource which we can sell

3. Create a Market

    - Create object with info about items selling, all apart from max supply such as we defined it in Selling resource

## Users to buy tokens have to do next:

1. Go to store. Also in future we could create some page with all the stores where users can choose what they want to buy

2. Choose token and click "Buy"

    - Under the hood next things will happen:

        - TradeHistory account will be created where we track how many tokens this user already bought

        - Debit and credit operations

        - New NFT created(create mint, mint token, create Metadata, create MasterEdition)

3. Token will be shown in their wallets
