# Token Entangler

Metaplex's Token Entangler program is pulled straight out of quantum mechanics! It enables you to entangle two NFTs together and make it so only one can exist in the wild at a time (and can always be exchanged with the entangled NFT). This could be useful to **'de-rug'** projects by replacing all the rugged NFTs with a new non-rug set.
