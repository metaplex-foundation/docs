The Gumdrop program enables easy token airdrops and print edition airdrops, without requiring high up-front rent costs.
Originally pioneered for token airdrops by [Uniswap](https://github.com/Uniswap/merkle-distributor) and ported to Solana
by [Saber](https://github.com/saber-hq/merkle-distributor), is extended to allow printing editions of a master copy.
Moreover, Gumdrop allows creators to directly send whitelisted users a drop reclamation link by building the tree with
off-chain handles (e.g email, discord, etc.) and allowing the user to redeem into any wallet.
