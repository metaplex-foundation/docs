# Overview

## Introduction
Fusion is an NFT composability feature powered by the Trifle Program.
The Trifle Program is built upon the Escrow extension of Token Metadata. It uses a Creator Owned Escrow, or COE, using a Trifle PDA as the creator and manager of the COE. Its purpose is to add on-chain tracking and composability around NFT ownership. Additionally, the ability to specify rules and effects around token ownership allows for complex ownership models to be implemented by creators.
