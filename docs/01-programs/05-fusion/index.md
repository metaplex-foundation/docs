# Fusion

Fusion is an extension of the Token Metadata contract. It was created as a new feature primitive that could optionally be added to all NFTs. At its core it is simply an escrow account attached to an NFT, enabling NFTs to become owners of other tokens. Trifle is the name of the program that makes this possible.
