# Sugar for Candy Machine V3

:::caution
Sugar support for Candy Machine V3 is experimental.
:::

The Candy Machine V3 is the latest iteration of the Metaplex Protocol's Candy Machine minting and distribution program. While the deploy of a Candy Machine V3 works largely similar to the previous V2 version, Sugar offers a set of new command to configure and manage a Candy Guard.

The Candy Machine V3 has a modular architecture, where the mint logic is separated from the mint access control &mdash; check the [overview](../../../01-programs/02-candy-machine/00-overview.md) to read more about Candy Machine V3 and Candy Guard.

This guide will walk throught the changes in the configuration for a Candy Machine V3 and the commands used to set up and manage a Candy Guard. It assumes that you are already familiar with how Sugar works and have deployed a Candy Machine &mdash; if that is not the case, we recommend to first complete the [My First Candy Machine](../02-tutorials/00-my-first-candy-machine.md) tutorial.

## Configuration

Since the configuration of the mint process has moved to **guards**, Sugar's config file has changed. A basic configuration without any guards is shown bellow:

```json
{
  "number": 10,
  "symbol": "TEST",
  "sellerFeeBasisPoints": 500,
  "isMutable": true,
  "isSequential": false,
  "creators": [
    {
      "address": "PanbgtcTiZ2PveV96t2FHSffiLHXXjMuhvoabUUKKm8",
      "share": 100
    }
  ],
  "uploadMethod": "bundlr",
  "awsConfig": null,
  "nftStorageAuthToken": null,
  "shdwStorageAccount": null,
  "pinataConfig": null,
  "hiddenSettings": null,
  "guards": null
}
```
 There are two new elements in the configuration file:

 - `isSequential`: indicates to whether a sequential index generation should be used during mint or not (recommended to set this value to `false`);
 - `guards`: indicates the configuration for the Candy Guard. If this value is set to `null`, a Candy Guard will not be used and minted will only be possible using the `mint_authority` of the Candy Machine.

 :::info
 You can use `sugar create-config` to create a basic configuration file. The Candy Guard configuration needs to be added manually.
 :::

## Available Guards

The Candy Guard ships with a total of [16 default guards](../../../01-programs/02-candy-machine/09-available-guards/). These guards can be used to define a single guard set, which will applied to every mint transaction, or to define groups. The example below shows a configuration file with 2 groups:

```json
{
  "number": 10,
  "symbol": "TEST",
  "sellerFeeBasisPoints": 500,
  "isMutable": true,
  "isSequential": false,
  "creators": [
    {
      "address": "PanbgtcTiZ2PveV96t2FHSffiLHXXjMuhvoabUUKKm8",
      "share": 100
    }
  ],
  "uploadMethod": "bundlr",
  "awsConfig": null,
  "nftStorageAuthToken": null,
  "shdwStorageAccount": null,
  "pinataConfig": null,
  "hiddenSettings": null,
  "guards": {
      "default": {
          "botTax": {
              "value": 10000000,
              "lastInstruction": true
          }
      },
      "groups": [
          {
              "label": "OGs",
              "guards": {
                  "startDate": {
                      "date": "2022-10-20 12:00:00 +0000"
                  },
                  "tokenGate": {
                      "amount": 1,
                      "mint": "7nE1GmnMmDKiycFkpHF7mKtxt356FQzVonZqBWsTWZNf"
                  },
                  "solPayment": {
                      "value": 1,
                      "destination": "PanbgtcTiZ2PveV96t2FHSffiLHXXjMuhvoabUUKKm8"
                  }
              }
          },
          {
              "label": "Public",
              "guards": {
                  "startDate": {
                      "date": "2022-10-20 18:00:00 +0000"
                  },
                  "solPayment": {
                      "value": 2,
                      "destination": "PanbgtcTiZ2PveV96t2FHSffiLHXXjMuhvoabUUKKm8"
                  }
              }
          }
      ]
  }
}
```

In this exaple, there are 2 groups `OGs` and `Public`. The `OGs` specifies that only transactions that are from an address which holds `1` token of the the SPL token `7nE1GmnMmDKiycFkpHF7mKtxt356FQzVonZqBWsTWZNf` are allowed to mint from the `2022-10-20 12:00:00 +0000`; the mint will be charged at `1 SOL`.

The `Public` group is open to any address from the `2022-10-20 18:00:00 +0000`; the mint will be charged at `2 SOL`.

For both groups, the `botTax` guard specified in the `default` guard set applies, so any transaction that fails the guard validation will be subject to a `0.01 SOL` fee.

If we wanted to have a single "public" group, all the guard configuration can be added to the `default` guard set:

```json
{
  "number": 10,
  "symbol": "TEST",
  "sellerFeeBasisPoints": 500,
  "isMutable": true,
  "isSequential": false,
  "creators": [
    {
      "address": "PanbgtcTiZ2PveV96t2FHSffiLHXXjMuhvoabUUKKm8",
      "share": 100
    }
  ],
  "uploadMethod": "bundlr",
  "awsConfig": null,
  "nftStorageAuthToken": null,
  "shdwStorageAccount": null,
  "pinataConfig": null,
  "hiddenSettings": null,
  "guards": {
      "default": {
          "botTax": {
              "value": 10000000,
              "lastInstruction": true
          },
          "startDate": {
              "date": "2022-10-20 18:00:00 +0000"
          },
          "solPayment": {
              "value": 2,
              "destiantion": "PanbgtcTiZ2PveV96t2FHSffiLHXXjMuhvoabUUKKm8"
          }
      },
      "groups": null
  }
}
```

Bellow is a list of the available guards and their configuration options.

### Address Gate

The AddressGate guard restricts the mint to a single address — the address must match the payer's address of the mint transaction.

```json
"addressGate" : {
    "address": "<PUBKEY>"
}
```

### Allow List

The AllowList guard validates the payer's address against a merkle tree-based allow list of addresses.

```json
"allowList" : {
    "merkleRoot": "<HASH>"
}
```

### Bot Tax

The BotTax guard is used to:
- charge a penalty for invalid transactions. The value of the penalty is specified by the lamports configuration.
- validate that the mint transaction is the last transaction (last_instruction = true).

The bot_tax is applied to any error that occurs during the validation of the guards.

```json
"botTax" : {
    "value": SOL value,
    "lastInstruction": boolean
}
```

### End Date

The End Date guard is used to specify a date to end the mint. Any transaction received after the end date will fail.

The date needs to be specified using [RFC 3339 standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339). In most cases, the format used will be "yyyy-mm-dd`T`hh:mm:ss`Z`", where `T` is the separator between the full-date and full-time and `Z` is the timezone offset from UTC (use `Z` or +00:00 for UTC time).

```json
"endDate" : {
    "date": "string",
}
```

### Gatekeeper

The Gatekeeper guard validates if the payer of the transaction has a token from a specified gateway network &mdash; in most cases, a token after completing a captcha challenge. The `expire_on_use` configuration is used to indicate whether or not the token should expire after minting.

```json
"gatekeeper" : {
    "gatekeeperNetwork": "<PUBKEY>",
    "expireOnUse": boolean
}
```

### Mint Limit

The MintL imit guard allows to specify a limit on the number of mints for each individual address. The `id` configuration represents the unique identification for the limit — changing the id has the effect of restarting the limit, since a different tracking account will be created. The `limit` indicates the maximum number of mints allowed.

```json
"mintLimit" : {
    "id": number,
    "limit": number
}
```

### NFT Burn

The NFT Burn guard restricts the mint to holders of another NFT (token), requiring that the NFT is burn in exchange of being allowed to mint.

```json
"nftBurn" : {
    "requiredCollection": "<PUBKEY>",
}
```

### NFT Gate

The NFT Gate guard restricts the mint to holders of a specified `required_collection` NFT collection. The payer is required to hold at least one NFT of the collection.

```json
"nftGate" : {
    "requiredCollection": "<PUBKEY>",
}
```

### NFT Payment

The NFT Payment guard is a payment guard that charges another NFT (token) from a specific collection for the mint. As a requirement of the mint, the specified NFT is transferred to the `destination` address.

```json
"nftPayment" : {
    "requiredCollection": "<PUBKEY>",
    "destination": "<PUBKEY>"
}
```

### Redeemed Amount

The Redeemed Amount guard stops the mint when the number of `items_redeemed` of the Candy Machine reaches the configured `maximum` amount.

```json
"redeemedAmount" : {
    "maximum": number,
}
```

### Sol Payment

The Sol Payment guard is used to charge an amount in SOL for the mint. The funds are transferred to the configured `destination` address.

```json
"solPayment" : {
    "value": SOL value,
    "destination": "<PUBKEY>"
}
```

### Start Date

The Start Date guard determines the start date of the mint. If this guard is not specified, mint is allowed — similar to say any date is valid.

The date needs to be specified using [RFC 3339 standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339). In most cases, the format used will be "yyyy-mm-dd`T`hh:mm:ss`Z`", where `T` is the separator between the full-date and full-time and `Z` is the timezone offset from UTC (use `Z` or +00:00 for UTC time).

```json
"startDate" : {
    "date": "string",
}
```

### Third Party Signer

The Third Party Signer guard required an extra signer on the transaction.

```json
"thirdPartySigner" : {
    "signerKey": "<PUBKEY>"
}
```

### Token Burn

The Token Burn guard restricts the mint to holder of a specified SPL Token and required the burn of the tokens. The `amount` determines how many tokens are required.

```json
"tokenBurn" : {
    "amount": number,
    "mint": "<PUBKEY>"
}
```

### Token Gate

The Token Gate guard restricts the mint to holder of a specified SPL Token. The `amount` determines how many tokens are required.

```json
"tokenGate" : {
    "amount": number,
    "mint": "<PUBKEY>"
}
```

### Token Payment

The Token Payment guard restricts the mint to holder of a specified SPL Token, transferring the required amount to the `destination_ata` address. The amount determines how many tokens are required.

```json
"tokenGate" : {
    "amount": number,
    "tokenMint": "<PUBKEY>",
    "destinationAta": "<PUBKEY>"
}
```

## Deployment Commands

The deployment of a Candy Machine V3 follows the same steps:

1. `sugar validate` to verify that all metadata is in place;
2. `sugar upload` to upload the metadata to the selected storage;
3. `sugar deploy` to create and deploy a Candy Machine;
4. `sugar verify` to verify that all information is on-chain.

At this point, your Candy Machine is deployed and allows minting only from the `mint_authority`, which is the address that created the Candy Machine. The next step is to add a Candy Guard to the Candy Machine to specify the mint configuration (access control).

There are 5 new commands in Sugar to create and interact with a Candy Guard:

- `add` to create a new candy guard over a candy machine;
- `update` to update the configuration of an existing candy guard;
- `show` to print the current configuration;
- `remove` to remove the candy guard from a candy machine;
- `withdraw` to close a candy guard account and retrieve the rent funds.

### `add`

Once you completed the guards configuration in your Sugar config file, you can add a Candy Guard using:

```
sugar guard add
```
