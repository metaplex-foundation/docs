# Upload NFT Assets

This section assumes you have completed the [prerequisites identified in the introduction](introduction#prerequisites). It also works with the [example collection](prepare-assets#example-two-item-collection) defined in the previous section, downloadable as [simple-collection.zip](./simple-collection.zip).

<!-- 1. Download and unzip [simple-collection.zip](./simple-collection.zip)
1. `cd` into the directory that creates
1. run upload commands -->

The commands in this section are long and use lots of arguments and flags. To avoid challenges this creates, it's helpful to keep the help documentation for this step handy. To view the help documentation, run:

command: 
```
ts-node ~/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts help upload
```

expected output:
```

```
