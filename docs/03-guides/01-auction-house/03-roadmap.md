# Auction House Roadmap

Our roadmap is dynamic, and we try to release features and fixes as they are ready but this board will give you a general sense of where we are heading with this Product.
We have two places where you can see the work being done. The Auction House work board and the Auction House Roadmap board.

## Work Board
This is the big list of bugs, features and ideas we are working through
The Auction House work board is located on GitHub here:

[Auction House work board](https://github.com/orgs/metaplex-foundation/projects/1/views/22)

In general the items with the label "Committed" are things we as a team and community have decided we want to support, while there will be many more items here they will most likley be ideas and bug reports. 
Items with a "Discuss" label are things we are in active dialogue with the community about supporting.
Items with a "Community" label are items that we would like to happen, but aren't actively working on but would love a community member to pick up.

## Roadmap Board
This is a curated list of things that we have committed to supporting or releasing. It lives here:

[Auction House Roadmap board](https://github.com/orgs/metaplex-foundation/projects/1/views/23)

This board contains "Core Committed" items.
