# Getting Started with AuctionHouse

The AuctionHouse is a Solana program running on Mainnet Beta and Devnet. While you may interact with it like any other Solana program by sending transactions to a Solana node, Metaplex has built some tools to make working with it much easier. We have a CLI tool that will let you manage your auction house and some reference JS code to help you build a user interface. 


### CLI

See [CLI](/auction-house/cli) for how to setup and use the CLI.

### JS SDK

MPL SDK (low level web3 focused sdk) https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaplex-foundation/mpl-auction-house

### UI Reference Implementation

Coming Soon

### Program API

See https://docs.rs/mpl-auction-house/latest/mpl_auction_house/
