# Configuration

The configuration in `CMv2` is now specified in a single JSON file. This allows you to save and reuse the configuration across multiple drops. Additionally, there is a single account on-chain that holds all the configuration of a Candy Machine and the values can be updated at any point. The way the Candy Machine operates depends on the settings used, and therefore it is the **most important part in setting up your Candy Machine**. It is crucial to understand how the settings work to decide which ones to use for your project.

We will discuss a few examples on how to set up a Candy Machine, starting with the settings to configure a `CMv2` to operate in a similar way as a `CMv1`.

The table below provides an overview of the settings available:

## Minimal Configuration

A minimal Candy Machine config settings looks like this:

```json
{
    "price": 1.0,
    "number": 10,
    "gatekeeper": null,
    "solTreasuryAccount": "<YOUR WALLET ADDRESS>",
    "splTokenAccount": null,
    "splToken": null,
    "goLiveDate": "25 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT",
    "endSettings": null,
    "whitelistMintSettings": null,
    "hiddenSettings": null,
    "storage": "arweave-sol",
    "ipfsInfuraProjectId": null,
    "ipfsInfuraSecret": null,
    "nftStorageKey": null,
    "awsS3Bucket": null,
    "noRetainAuthority": false,
    "noMutable": false
}
```

:::caution

The `number` of items setting can only be updated after you create your `CMv2` if you are using `hiddenSettings`. When `hiddenSettings` are not used, the `number` value is used to allocate the space required by the `CMv2` account and therefore cannot be modified.

In case you require to change the `number` of items after creating a `CMv2` without `hiddenSettings`, you can withdraw rent of your current `CMv2` and then create a new one.

:::

The above settings will configure a `CMv2` to operate in a similar way as a `CMv1` – although the mint order will be unpredictable. In other words, even the most simple v2 configuration provides an improvement over v1. You can view this as the minimum set of settings required to create a Candy Machine. Many projects will be using a similar set of settings, as this already provides a fully-working on-chain distribution mechanism.

The settings that are specified in this example are:
- price
- number
- solTreasureAccount
- goLiveDate
- noRetainAuthority
- noMutable

If this satisfies the requirement for your project, save these settings to a file (e.g., `config.json`) and you are ready to start uploading your items and create a Candy Machine. Below we will discuss other configuration examples that represent specific use-cases. These examples will use the settings above as a starting point and provide the settings section to be added/updated. 

:::info

It is important that the `number` setting value matches the number of items in your Candy Machine.

:::

## Gatekeeper Settings

While the unpredictable mint index provides some protection against bots, bots are still able to mint directly from the Candy Machine. If you want to make sure that only humans can mint from your project, you can enable the gatekeeper settings in your `config.json` with the following values:

```json
"gatekeeper": {
    "gatekeeperNetwork" : "<PROVIDER NETWORK ADDRESS>",
   	"expireOnUse" : true
}
```
This will enable a gatekeeper challenge once the mint button is clicked&mdash;only after passing the challenge you will be allowed to mint.

When you use a gatekeeper, you will not be able to mint from the CLI command `mint_one_token`. If you want to pre-mint from a `CMv2` and are planning to use a gatekeeper, you should set the `goLiveDate` to `null` and turn `gatekeeper` (temporarily) off. This will allow you to mint from the command line, but only **you** as the `CMv2` authority. Once you complete the pre-mint, turn `gatekeeper` on and set the correct `goLiveDate`.

:::warning

If your Candy Machine is **live** and it has **no gatekeeper**, it is open to bots attacks. The unpredictable mint index only prevents knowing which item to mint, but bots can still snipe a large volume of items.

:::

### Provider Networks

There are currently two supported gatekeepers (details below). If you want to become a supported gatekeeper please email [contact@identity.org](mailto:contact@identity.org).
> [Learn more about the Identity Gateway Protocol](https://docs.identity.com/docs/overview)

#### Civic Captcha Pass

> Address: `ignREusXmGrscGNUesoU9mxfds9AiYTezUKex2PsZV6`

**Recommended**: maintain `expireOnUse: true`. Changing this setting increases the susceptibility of your project to bots.

Brings the familiar captcha challenge to web3 and combines it with user-transparent heuristics to protect your mint from bots.

With captcha enabled, a user will be issued a Civic Captcha Pass after successfully completing the captcha challenge and automatically checked by the Candy Machine prior to minting. 

A Civic Captcha Pass remains active only for 10 minutes and for one mint to limit the options of malicious botters verifying multiple wallets. If a user tries to use an inactive pass, it will automatically prompt them to refresh it.

:::info

By using a gatekeeper, you agree to their terms and conditions.

## Hidden Settings

Hidden settings serve two purposes. First, it allows the creation of larger drops (20k+), since the metadata is not stored on-chain. In turn, this also allows the creation of hide-and-reveal drops, where users discover which item(s) they minted after the mint is complete.

To enable hidden settings, you need to provide the details for the *hiddenSettings* in your `config.json`:

```json
"hiddenSettings": {
    "name":"My Hidden Collection ",
   	"uri":"uri",
	"hash":"44kiGWWsSgdqPMvmqYgTS78Mx2BKCWzd"
}
```
Once hidden settings are enabled, every mint will have the same URI and the name will be created by appending the mint number (e.g., “#45”) to the name specified. The hash is expected to be a 32 character string corresponding to the hash of a cache file that has the mapping between a mint number and the actual metadata URI. This allows the order of the mint to be verified by others after the mint is complete.

Since the metadata is not on-chain, it is possible to create very large drops. The only caveat is that there is a need for an off-chain process to update the metadata for each item. This is important otherwise all items will have the same metadata.

## End Settings

End Settings provides a mechanism to stop the mint if a certain condition is met without interaction. There are two conditions that can be specified.

Stop a mint at a specific timestamp (e.g., at the end of a specific day):

```json
"endSettings": {
	"endSettingType": { "date":true },
	"value":"25 Dec 2021 23:59:00 GMT"
}
```
Stop a mint after a certain amount of item have been minted (e.g., 10 items minted):

```json
"endSettings": {
	"endSettingType": { "amount":true },
	"value":10
}
```

This can be used in combination with other settings to create specific use cases. For example, you can run a whitelist presale either for a limited time or for a limited number of items; you can specify your sale period to be between the `goLiveDate` and the `endSettings`'s `date`.

## Whitelist Settings

Whitelist settings provide a variety of different use cases and revolve around the idea of using custom SPL tokens to offer special rights to token holders - how said SPL token is distributed is up to you. We will discuss a few scenarios below.

> In all the examples below, you will need to change the `mint` settings address `7nE1GmnMmDKiycFkpHF7mKtxt356FQzVonZqBWsTWZNf` with the mint address of your SPL token.

:::info

You can use the whitelist settings with the `presale` option set to `true` in combination with the gateway settings. This will restrict the mint to only whitelist users and require them to complete the Gatekeeper's challenge.

:::

- Creating a whitelist **only** for presale (e.g., allow whitelist users to mint before the `goLiveDate`) and burning the whitelist token each time. Once the sales begin, whitelist users do not have any privileges.

    ```json
    "whitelistMintSettings": {
        "mode" : { "burnEveryTime": true },
        "mint" : "7nE1GmnMmDKiycFkpHF7mKtxt356FQzVonZqBWsTWZNf",
        "presale" : true,
        "discountPrice" : null
    }
    ```

- Creating a whitelist for presale, burning the whitelist token each time and provide whitelist users with a 0.5 SOL price tag instead (specified by the `discountPrice`). Once the sales begin (i.e., everyone can mint), the whitelist gets you only the discount.

    ```json
    "whitelistMintSettings": {
        "mode" : { "burnEveryTime": true },
        "mint" : "7nE1GmnMmDKiycFkpHF7mKtxt356FQzVonZqBWsTWZNf",
        "presale" : true,
        "discountPrice" : 0.5
    }
    ```

- Creating a whitelist for presale, not burning the whitelist token (you will be able to reuse it) and give whitelist users a 0.5 SOL price tag instead. Once the sales begin (i.e., everyone can mint), the whitelist gets you only the discount.

    ```json
    "whitelistMintSettings": {
        "mode" : { "neverBurn": true },
        "mint" : "7nE1GmnMmDKiycFkpHF7mKtxt356FQzVonZqBWsTWZNf",
        "presale" : true,
        "discountPrice" : 0.5
    }
    ```

- Creating a whitelist, not burning the whitelist token (you will be able to reuse it) and gives whitelist users a 0.5 SOL price tag instead - i.e., the whitelist **only** gets you the discount.

    ```json
    "whitelistMintSettings": {
        "mode" : { "neverBurn": true },
        "mint" : "7nE1GmnMmDKiycFkpHF7mKtxt356FQzVonZqBWsTWZNf",
        "presale" : false,
        "discountPrice" : 0.5
    }
    ```

- Creating a whitelist, burning the whitelist token each time, running the white list during the sale. This in effect restrict any user without the whitelist token from minting at all - this is why `presale` is set to `false` and `discountPrice` set to `null`. The only purpose of the whitelist is to **restrict** the mint.

    ```json
    "whitelistMintSettings": {
        "mode" : { "burnEveryTime": true },
        "mint" : "7nE1GmnMmDKiycFkpHF7mKtxt356FQzVonZqBWsTWZNf",
        "presale" : false,
        "discountPrice" : null
    }
    ```

## Finishing up

Once you have decided which settings are suitable for your project, save your settings in a json file - in this guide we will be using a file called `config.json`. At this point, you are ready to start uploading your assets to the Candy Machine.
