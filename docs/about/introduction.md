# Introduction
The Metaplex team has been moving quickly to support the thousands of projects looking to launch their NFT projects on Solana. We've done a good job of creating tools like our [Candy Machine](https://metaplex.github.io/docs/docs/create-candy/introduction), to help spin up the common profile picture projects you all know and love. We've also been hard at work creating primitives, recipies, and extensible store fronts that developers and artists alike can use. 

We're excited to see what you build with metaplex, if you have questions please reach out on our [discord!](https://discord.com/invite/metaplex)

## What is Solana?
Metaplex is built on [Solana](https://crypto-wikipedia.com/what-is-solana-sol/) because it is not only scaleable but because it has a lot of other great features like its ["Proof of History"](https://solana.com/news/proof-of-history---a-clock-for-blockchain) feature. Solana has gained a reputation as being a great place to launch NFT's in part because of the work of the Metaplex team. Initally a Solana initative we were spun out in order to better align with our goals of creating a best in class NFT creator experience. 

## What is Metaplex? 
Metaplex is a collection of tools, smart contracts, and more designed to make the process of creating and launching NFTs easier. While initially focused on supporting the needs of the arts and entertainment industry our plans extend far beyond that to all use cases where an NFT may add value. 

Currently our two major projects are:
- [Stores](https://metaplex.github.io/docs/docs/create-store/introduction) a generalizable NFT selling standard
- [The Candie Machine](https://metaplex.github.io/docs/docs/create-candy/introduction) a PFP focused tool that works like the gumball style candie machines of old 

## What next for Metaplex?
We have big plans. Like any startups we see a bright future for the tools and services we off and plan to offer. But for now we're doing what any great business does an remaining hyper focused on the task at hand, namely building great experiences for NFT creators and developers. If you want to help us on our mission we're [hiring](https://apply.workable.com/metaplex-studios/). 

## Thank you and stay in touch!
This project wouldn't exist without you. We are thankful that you're using these tools and we want to make them better for you! Please reach out on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/metaplex) if you have any questions, or better yet make a pull request!
