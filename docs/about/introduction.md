# Introduction
Metaplex Studios, ecosystem, and community have been moving quickly to support the thousands of developer teams and creators looking to launch their NFT projects on Solana. In response to feedback, we've created tools like our [Candy Machine™](./create-candy/introduction), to help mint and sale thousands of NFTs for NFT collections and/or common profile picture projects you all know and love. We've also been hard at work creating primitives, recipies, and extensible storefronts that developers and creators alike can use.

We're excited to see what you build with metaplex, if you have questions please reach out on our [discord!](https://discord.com/invite/metaplex)

## What is Solana?
Metaplex is built on [Solana](https://crypto-wikipedia.com/what-is-solana-sol/) because it is not only scaleable but because it has a lot of other great features like its ["Proof of History"](https://solana.com/news/proof-of-history---a-clock-for-blockchain) feature. Solana has gained a reputation as being a great place to launch NFT's in part because of the work of the Metaplex team. Initally a Solana initative, we were spun out in order to better align with our goals of creating a best in class NFT creator experience. 

## What is Metaplex? 
Metaplex is a collection of tools, smart contracts, and more designed to make the process of creating and launching NFTs easier. While initially focused on supporting the needs of the arts and entertainment industry our plans extend far beyond that to all use cases where an NFT may add value. 

Currently our two major projects are:
- [Stores](./create-store/introduction) a generalizable NFT selling standard
- [The Candy Machine™](./create-candy/introduction) a PFP focused tool that works like the gumball style candie machines of old 

## What next for Metaplex?
We have big plans. Based on response from the Metaplex Community, we see a bright future and lots of demand for the tools and services the help people everywhere create awesome NFT projects. Currently, we're remaining hyper focused on the task at hand, namely building great experiences for NFT creators and developers starting with creator storefronts and helping creators distribute NFTs to their communities via auctions, instant sales, NFTs, and even more ways coming very, very soon. If you want to help us on our mission we're [hiring](https://apply.workable.com/metaplex-studios/). Or, if you have ideas for your own project that furthers the capabilities of the Metaplex Ecosystem through smart contracts and beyond, we're providing grants.
