# Introduction

Metaplex is a protocol built on top of Solana that allows:

- **Creating/Minting** non-fungible tokens;
- **Starting** a variety of auctions for primary/secondary sales;
- and **Visualizing** NFTs in a standard way across wallets and applications.

Metaplex comprises two core components: an on-chain program, and a self-hosted front-end web3 application.
