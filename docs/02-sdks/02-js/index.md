# JavaScript SDK

This SDK helps developers get started with the on-chain tools provided by Metaplex. It focuses its API on common
use-cases to provide a smooth developer experience whilst allowing third parties to extend its features via plugins.

Please note that this SDK has been re-implemented from scratch and is still in active development. This means some of
the core API and interfaces might change from one version to another. However, feel free to use it and provide some
early feedback if you wish to contribute to the direction of this project. 

In the meantime, the README page on the [JS SDK GitHub][github] is a great place to get started.
