# Deployment Roadmap

V1.1.0 has been deployed to devnet so that ecosystem partners, stakeholders and the broader community can test it out and experiment with it. This page describes the current status of the standard and the roadmap that will take it to finalization and mainnet deployment.

## Work Board

The Github work board with a list of outstanding tasks can be viewed [here](https://github.com/orgs/metaplex-foundation/projects/1/views/25
).

In general the items with the commitment level "Core Committed" are things we as a team and community have decided we want to support, while there will be many more items here they will most likley be ideas and bug reports. Items with a "Reviewing" commitment level are things we are in active dialogue with the community about supporting. Items witha "Community" label are items that we would like to see , but arent activley working on but would love a community member to pick up.

* Standard implementation finished -- Jan 10th
