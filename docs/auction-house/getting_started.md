# Getting Started with AuctionHouse

The AuctionHouse is a Solana program running on Mainnet Beta and Devnet. While you may interact with it like any other Solana program by sending transactions to a Solana node, Metaplex has built some tools to make working with it much easier. We have a CLI tool that will let you manage your auction house and some reference JS code to help you build a user interface. 


### CLI

See [CLI](/auction-house/cli) for how to setup and use the CLI.

### JS SDK

Coming Soon

### UI Reference Implementation

Coming Soon

### Program API

See [Account/Instruction API Documentation](https://metaplex-foundation.github.io/metaplex-program-library/mpl_auction_house)
